# JavaSeleniumAutomation

Hi everyone,

This Selenium Framework was created as a Final Project of the Udemy course: Selenium WebDriver Training with Java and Many Live Projects, Teacher Raman Arora.

This build is a Maven Project compiled on InteliJ, the dependencies are included in the POM.xml. The architecture of the framework is based on Page Object Model with Page Factories with Selenium. 

It also includes functionalities such as:
- Excel Reader, TestNG reporting, including TestNG Annotations and Data Providers;
- Run through Jenkins and send an email with the results - through Extent Reports; 

For testing, I have created a suite composed by 3 test cases to test a portuguese bookstore website - www.wook.pt:
1. Log in log out;
2. Add a book to favorites;
3. Buy a book;
